                        <p>Sophia sat on the floor of her laundry room, looking at the lipstick mark on Peter’s shirt. She brought it up to her face to smell it. The way their smells mingled made her head dizzy. It was no secret there was another woman. He’d not cheated. Soon as he was sure, he had confessed. Of course there was shouting, crying, going silent and all those things, but she’d agreed, on one single thread. The way Peter had told her that he still loved her as much as before and how she could see in...</p>

Since he’d left, this is what sleeping had become, hanging somewhere in-between, in an uncomfortable state of trance. She’d seen him last on their wedding night. His first love had called and he’d left, kissing her goodbye, promising to return. She watched him walk out, that handsome, well-built man in a uniform...</p>

This was the third time in a row he’d taken that name while making love to his wife. Raashi took his hand off herself and got up. She put on a robe and went into the study. “He did it again tonight” she texted Meera. “Why don’t you just ask him” Meera replied. “He doesn’t remember. He used to say other things when…you know when. But next day when I used to tease him, he wouldn’t..</p>

But the moment they met, it seemed like no time had passed between them. Now at a bar, they were buzzed on margaritas. “I’d say may be a couple of months ago” Vaidehi replied...
